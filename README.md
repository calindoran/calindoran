# Hi, I'm Calin Doran ✌️

I'm a software engineer and part-time musician from Ireland. I currently work at Intellync as a frontend/app engineer, where I focus on building features for a range of products.

## Interests 💡

- Some of my interests would be building web and native applications, building computers and music.
- I’m currently learning more about full-stack development using Python as a backend and whatever new interesting React framework seems best for the project.
