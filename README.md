# Hey, I'm Calin ✌️

I'm a software engineer and part-time musician from Ireland. I currently work at Intellync as a frontend/app engineer, where I focus on building features for a range of products.

## 💡 Interests:

- Some of my interests would be building web and native applications, building computers and music.
- I’m currently learning more about full-stack development using Python as a backend and whatever new interesting React framework seems best for the project.

## 📚 Tech Stack:

- ⚛ React, React Native and Expo for cross-platform applications. In my own time I like to work on personal projects that would involve these technologies in some shape or form.

- ✅ Front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Typescript.

- 📖 Learning: Offline first development, which includes Redux and Drizzle ORM.

- 🐍 Learning: Python, including data analysis and rest APIs. Frameworks include but are not limited to Django, FastAPI and Flask.

- 🛠️ SQL and SQLite would be my go to database languages, with some mongodb and firebase.

- 🐋 Docker is a great tool, I like to use that as frequently as possible for prototyping a new project.
